CodeIgniter 2.2 Session Class using native php sessions
====================================

Updated Library class for handling Sessions natively instead of cookie based for Codeigniter 2.2

Place in your <b>application/library/</b> 

It should load instead of your system class in 2.2 if named the same. 

Comments in code show changed areas from Cookie to Native Sessions for PHP
